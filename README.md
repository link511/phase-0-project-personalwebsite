## What the project does?

This project's aim is to show that layouts and contents can be created using different styles of HTML and CSS codes.  I have included the following types of code on the website.

 1. Basic HTML layout such as using the following tags:
          - body
          - br
          - ul / li
          - section
          - div
          - a href
          - class
          - figure
          - img 
          - form
          - label
          - textarea
          - input
2. CSS tags 
           - box-sizing
           - font
           - background
           - padding
           - display
           - margin
           - flex-directions
           - border
           - @ media
           - flexbox concept
           - flexgrid concept
           - etc.

### Webpage contents and layouts

There are a total of 4 pages and is a travel tour industry website.  Each page has a header with a couple of button links connecting to different pages.  The pages contain images showing the reader what destination tours are available. 

For each page, I tried to use different styles of coding to style the page.

**Index page** - I used flexbox to display the images and display blocks for the navigation section.

**Home page** - I used flex grid to display the images and company description

**Overseas and Local tours** - I used flexbox to arrange the image and the paragraph descriptions.

**Registration** - I used <form> tag to get the user input and flexbox to arrange the layout.  I also used the "required" code and radio button to get the user information.

**Each page** - On each page, I make sure that there is a link at the bottom the user can select to bring the browser back to the top.   I also use media query so that it is suitable for iPad size (820 x 1180) format.

## Why the project is useful?

This project is useful in the travel industry as it has the ability to arrange the destination images in a readable form.   It can be more reactive once JavaScript is included.
